  "summary": " The total paid-up share capital of DSQ Industries Ltd. was Rs. 20,04,29,160 consisting of 2,00,42,916 shares of Rs. 10/10/10 . It was noticed that there were discrepancies in the distribution schedule filed by the company with the CSE and with SEBI .  An associate of Shri Harish Biyani entered into cross deals also. between 2 brokers – namely Shri . Harish . Hari Hari and Amritlal Gopalji Thacker . Thacker placed a buy order no. 180721378 at 14.52.17 hrs for 100 shares @ Rs. 366 when the last traded price was Rs. 363.8.8 .  Trading was concentrated among 3 brokers namely Shri Harish Biyani, Niraj Kumar Balasaria and Amritlal Gopalji Thacker . There was creation of artificial market and artificial volumes as a result of synchronization of logging in / matching of buy and sell orders amongst few brokers .  Shares were brought in synchronised deals with buying and selling orders logged in at almost the same time for same rate and quantity with prior understanding to match sell orders with specific buy orders . Shares effectively did not change beneficial ownership by remaining within DSQ group .  Biyani Securities Pvt. Ltd. sold as empanelled broker a total of 10.4 lakh shares of DSQ . The buy and sell orders were placed in close proximity of time 5-15 seconds . Investigations brought out that the off market transfer of 3,00,000 shares was from the demat account of Square D Textiles – a DSQ group entity .  The contentions by Biyani Securities Pvt. Ltd. that they sold 1.7 lakh shares on behalf of DSQ group entity – Hulda is not tenable . Many of the buying clients as above have same address as that of ‘Hulda’ and also Mr Bhalotia as common director in Hulda . The order log and trade log revealed that there was synchronization of orders .  Shri Harish Biyani used shares of DSQ Industries for availing finance in the ‘sell and cash’ scheme of SHCIL by selling shares as empanelled broker . These shares were credited as off market purchases and were credited from the demat account of Hulda . CSE had subsequently expunged the transaction of 2,40,000 shares amounting to Rs 8.04 crore on the grounds that the transactions were non genuine .  Shri Harish Biyani requested SHCIL to sell 2.4 lakh shares of DSQ Industries Ltd under ‘sell-n-cash’ scheme . Under this scheme the payment is released one day after the pay out of the relevant 4.19 .  The transactions done by Biyani group of brokers in the ‘sell n cash’ scheme of SCHIL on 27/2/01 and 1/3/01 are strong pointer to the promoter broker nexus between DSQ Group and Biyaani group . The transactions also created artificial market, creation of artificial volumes as a result of synchronization of buy and sell orders .  In appeal no – Nirmal Bang Securities Pvt. Ltd vs. SEBI, the Hon’ble Securities Appellate Tribunal has held as under with regard to “BEB has been charged for synchronized deals with First Global.”  Biyani Securities Pvt. Ltd. sold 7.2 lac shares of DSQ Industries, Shri Harish Biyan purchased 2.2 . Lived in a series of irregular transactions by way of synchronized trades and cross deals .  Problem at CSE was building up of large outstanding positions by few brokers in few scrips mainly in HFCL and DSQ and volatility in the prices .  The strict rules of Evidence Act and proof beyond reasonable doubt are not applicable to a proceeding of this nature . The Supreme Court’s decision in Gulabchand vs. Kudilal AIR, 1966, SC 1734 is relied upon in this regard .",

An appeal from the High Court at Calcutta (Harries C.J. and Chatterjea J.) pronounced on a reference made to it by the Income.tax Tribunal under section 66 (2) of the Indian Income-tax Act, 1922 . Held, that the High. Court acted wrongly in accepting the argurr1ents of the assessees' counsel as if they were proved facts .  The Calcutta Agency Ltd. instituted four suits in High Court being suit Nos. 1683, 1720, 1735 and for the said aggregate sum of Rs. 1,80,000 and the interest thereon . The Tribunal rejected that argument and the High Court also rejected the same .  Mills Ltd. agreed to Kania o. J. deduct certain amounts from the managing agency commission and therefore such expenditure came with- in section 10(2) (xv) of the Act . Chatterjea J. observed as follows as follows:-\"In this case it is clear that the agreement was entered into with a view to avoid publicity of an action against the Mana- ging agents and consequent exposure and scandal\"  Court differed from the conclusion of the Tribunal and allowed the deduction to the respondent company under section 10(2) (xv) of the Income-tax Act . Ka1ita C. J, assailed on the ground that there was no evidence for the conclusions on facts recorded by the Tribunal . It is therefore the duty of the High Court to look at the facts found by the tribunal and answer the questions of law on that footing .  The contention was that this sum should be treated as not having become the income of the assessee at all because it was deducted at the source by the Mill company . No evidence, it appears, was led before the Income Tax Tribunal, nor has the Tribunal recorded any findings of fact on which the principles laid down in Mitchell's case(') could be applied .",

  "summary": " An Act to consolidate and amend the provisions relating to offences and for matters connected therewithor incidentalthereto. B E it enacted by Parliament in the Seventy-fourth Year of the Republic of India as follows .  The pronoun “he” and its derivatives are used of any person, whether male, female or transgender . “Death” means the death of a human being unless the contrary appears from the context . ‘Dishonestly’ means doing anything with the intention of causing wrongful gain to one person or wrongful loss to another person .  The word “illegal” is applicable to everything which is an offence or which is prohibited by law, or which furnishes ground for a civil action . A person is said to be “legally bound to do” whatever it is illegal in him to omit . “Injury” means any harm whatever illegally caused to any person, in body, mind, reputation or property; (16 ) “Judge” includes a person who is empowered by law to give a definitive judgment, or a judgment which, if not appealed against, would be definitive .  word “offence” means a thing punishable under this Sanhita, or under any special law or local law . “omission” denotes as well as a series of omissions as a single omission . ‘person’ includes any company or association or body of persons, whether incorporated or not; “public” includes any class of the public or any community; ‘public servant’ means a person falling under descriptions .  A sets fire, by night, to an inhabited house in a large town, for the purpose of facilitating a robbery and thus causes the death of a person . A writes his name on the back of a bill of exchange. As the effect of this endorsement is to transfer the right to the bill to any person who may become the lawful holder of it, the endorsement is a “valuable security”  “wrongful gain” means gain by unlawful means of property to which the person gaining is not legally entitled . “A person is said to gain wrongfully when such person retains wrongfully, as well as when such persons acquires wrongfully. of any age; ( 36 ) “Gaining wrongfully” and “losing wrongfully .” are used in every Part of this Sanhita in conformity with the explanation .  A and B intentionally cooperate in the commission of murder by doing any one of those acts, either singly or jointly with any other person, commits that offence . The punishments to which offenders are liable under the provisions of this Sanhita are—— ( c ) A, a jailor, has the charge of Z, a prisoner, alternatively for six hours at a time .  The appropriate Government may, without the consent of the offender, commute any punishment under this Sanhita to any other punishment . In calculating fractions of terms of punishment, imprisonment for life shall be reckoned as equivalent to imprisonment for twenty years unless otherwise provided .  The imprisonment which is imposed in default of payment of a fine shall terminate whenever that fine is either paid or levied by process of law . The death of the offender does not discharge from the liability any property which would, after his death, be legally liable for his debts .  If a person were liable to punishment for every blow, he might be imprisoned for fifty years, one for each blow . But, if, whileAis beating Z, Y interferes, and .Aintentionally strikes Y, here, as the blow given to Y is no part of the act wherebyAvoluntarily causes hurt to Z, .Ais liable to one punishment for voluntarily causing hurt to . Z, a soldier, fires on a mob by the order of his superior officer .  Nothing is an offence which is done by a Judge when acting judicially in the exercise of any power which is, or which in good faith, given to him by law . Asees Z commit what appears to be a murder. by that Court to arrest Y, and, after due enquiry, believing Z to be Y, arrests Z. A has committed no offence .  Nothing is an offence which is done by a child under seven years of age and under twelve years of . age, who has not attained sufficient maturity of understanding to judge of the nature and consequences of his conduct on that occasion . A person who, at the time of doing it, by reason of unsoundness of mind, is incapable of knowing the nature of the act .  Nothing, which is not intended to cause death, is an offence by reason of any harm which it may cause, or be intended by the doer to cause, to any person for whose benefit it is done in good faith, and who has given a consent, whether express or implied, to suffer that harm, or to take the risk of that harm . If A, while playing fairly, hurts Z,Acommits no offence .  Causing miscarriage (unless caused in good faith for the purpose of saving the life of the woman) is an offence independently of any harm which it may cause or be intended to cause to the woman . Therefore, it is not an offence “by reason of such harm”; and the consent of the . woman or of her guardian to the causing of such miscarriage does not justify the act .  No communication made in good faith is an offence by reason of any harm to the person to whom it is made . Except murder, and offences against the State punishable with death, nothing is done by a person who is compelled to do it by threats, which, at the time of doing it, reasonably cause the apprehension that instant death will otherwise be the consequence .  Z, a person of unsound mind, attempts to kill A; Z is guilty of no offence . But A has the same right of private defence against Z, which he would have if Z were sane . (b) against an act which does not reasonably cause the apprehension of death or of grievous hurt, if done, by a public servant acting in good faith under colour of his office .  The right of private defence of the body commences as soon as a reasonable apprehension of danger to the body arises from an attempt or threat to commit the offence though the offence may not have been committed . The right does not extend to the voluntary causing of death to the assailant, but does extend, subject to the restrictions specified in section 37, to voluntary causing to the wrong-doer of any harm other than death .  A person who, by wilful misrepresentation, causes or procures, or attempts to cause or procure, a thing to be done, is said to instigate the doing of that thing . A public officer is authorised by a warrant from a Court to apprehend Z. B, knowing that fact and also that C is not Z, wilfully represents to Athat C is Z, and thereby intentionally causes A to apprehend C .  A, with a guilty intention, abets a child or a person of unsound mind to commit an act which would be an offence, if committed by a person capable by law of committing an offence . B, in consequence of the abetment, does the act in the absence of A and thereby causes Z’s death . B has committed no offence, but A is guilty of abetting the offence of setting fire to a house .  A person abets an offence within the meaning of this Sanhita who, in India, abets the commission of any act without and beyond India which would constitute an offence if committed in India . A person in India instigates B, a foreigner in country X, to commit a murder in that country, A is guilty of abetting murder .  A instigates B to burn Z’s house, B sets fire to the house and at the same time commits theft of property there . A is not guilty of abetting the theft of the house, for the theft was a distinct act, and not a probable consequence of the burning . If A knew that the grievous hurt abetted was likely to cause death, A is liable to be punished with the punishment provided for murder .  Whoever abets an offence punishable with imprisonment shall, if that offence be not committed in consequence of the abetment, be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to seven years, and shall also be liable to fine .  Whoever intending to facilitate or knowing it to be likely that he will thereby facilitate the commission of an offence punishable with death or imprisonment for life, voluntarily conceals by any act or omission, or by the use of encryption or any other information hiding tool, the existence of a design to commit such offence . A has committed the offence defined in this section. the purpose of attacking the members of an adverse sect, while engaged in a procession .

Whoever, by deceitful means or by making promise to marry to a woman without any intention of fulfilling the same, has sexual intercourse with her, such sexual intercourse not amounting to the offence of rape, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description .  The printing or publication of the judgment of any High Court or the Supreme Court does not amount to an offence within the meaning of this section . Whoever prints or publishes any matter in relation to any proceeding before a Court without the previous permission of such Court shall be punished with imprisonment .  ‘Private act’ includes an act of watching carried out in a place where the victim’s genitals, posterior or breasts are exposed or covered only in underwear; or the victim is using a lavatory . Whoever commits the offence of stalking shall be punished on first conviction with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to three years, and shall also be liable to fine .

Whoever commits dowry death shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than seven years but may extend to imprisonment for life .  Whoever kidnaps or abducts any woman with intent that she may be compelled, or knowing it to be likely that she will be compelled to marry any person against her will, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years and shall also be liable to fine .

A, knowing that Z is labouring under such a disease that a blow is likely to cause his death, strikes him with the intention of causing bodily injury . A is guilty of murder, although the blow might not have been sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause the death of a person in a sound state of health . A without any excuse fires a loaded cannon into a crowd of persons and kills one of them .  A, by instigation, voluntarily causes Z, a child to commit suicide .

  "summary": " There will be no further order and the acquittal will be left as it stands . The Bihar Land Reforms Act, 1950 (Bihar Act XXX of 1950), '*The Chief Justice, in his . judgment, dealt with the above The Uttar Pradesh Zamindari Abolition and Land Reform . Act No. I of 1951) (hereinafter referred to . the Bihar Act, the . Madhya Pradesh Act and the Uttar Pradesh Act . No. 4 clause (b) is therefore unconstitutional results in reducing the compensation is unwarranted and there . fore a fraud on the Constitution .  The power to take compulsorily raises by implication a right to payment . The exercise of such power has been recognised in the jurisprudence of all civilised countries as conditioned by public necesces .  Mr. Somayya said the Madhya Pradesh Act was not dUly passed as no question was put by the Speaker, at the third reading of the bilf, on the motion that it be passed into law, as required by the provisions of rule 20 (1) of the rules governing legislative business then in force . The court is barred from enquiring into under article 212 (1), of the Constitution .  Act mainly rests on contention that it is implicit within the language of entry 36 of List II of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution that pro- perty could not be acquired without payment of com- pensation . The only effect of a compulsory power of acquisition against the individual being that there is entry 36 is conditional on exercise of power under entry 42 . Section 32 Government to make rules for carrying out the pro- visions of the Act .  Section 9 was mentioned under which mines in the -course of development and fetching no income yet lakhs out of the arrears, while in Case No. Proprietary Ltd. v. Dy. Commissioner of Taxation for New Sottth Wales . In Westminster Corporation v. London & North Western Raz'lway, it was observed :- \"It is well settled that a public body invested with statutory powers such as those conferred upon the corporation must take care not to exceed or abuse its powers\"  The whole purpose of this head of/ MohajanJ legislation is to provide payment of compensati_on andi . The deduction under clause (f) from the gross income is merely a deduction of an artificial character, the -whole objecLbeing.. to inflate the deductions and thusJ1ring_about_11on,pay- ment of compens_aJ;ion .  Mr. Raghav Saran who appeared in Cases Nos. 310, Petition No. under article 32 is dismissed as it is not maintainable . No infringement of any fundamental right has been alleged therein . Arrears of rent, therefore, are the subject-matter of separate and indi- vate property is taken, a pecuniary compensation must be paid .  Bihar Land Reforms Act, 1950 (Bihar Act XXX of 1950) was challenged by different proprietors of estates in Bihar challenging the constitutional validity of the Act . Bihar Legislature had no power to enact the said Act inasmuch as it makes no provision for the payment of just compensation for the proposed acqui- sition of zamindaries and tenures .  Article 246 does not make it obli- of Lords case, says Mr. P. R. Das . The obligation to provide for compensation is not included in the content of the legislative power sition or taking possession of property which does not pro-ifide for compensation .  Article 31 (4) and the added articles debar the respondents from questioning the validity of the Act on the ground, inter alia, that it contravenes or is inconsistent with or takes away or abridges any of the rights conferred by the provisions of clause (2) of article 31 . The obligation to provide for compensation not being im- plicit m or a part and parcel of the legislative power under entry 36 in List II read by itself or in conjunction with entry 42 in List III .  The argument that the .Act is unconstitutional is founded on the assumption that it has not laid down any principle for determining compensation . I do not think the Court can go into the policy of the legislation . All that the Court is concerned with is to see whether any principle has been laid down as mentioned in entry 42 in List III .  The Act cannot be called in question on the ground of legislative incompetence of the Bihar Legislature to enact it under entry 36 in List II or entry 42 in List III . Article 31 is one of a group of articles included in Part III of the Constitution under the heading \"Funda- mental Rights\"  The Bihar Legislature had no legislative com- petency under entry 36 in List II to enact the impug- ned Act and that this ground of attack, is still available . Mr. P. R. Das J. Das, of the Patna High Court summarises the position thus :- \"No satisfactory definition of the term \"public use\" is not confined to what may constitute a public use at ·any given time, but in general it may be said to cover  The payment of compensation is an essential ele- ment of the valid exercise of the power to take . Article 31 (4) debars the challenge of an Act on this ground but no other . Whether there is any public purpose at all is open, in my opinion, to judicial scrutiny or review .  A railroad company filed a suit to The provisions in section 23, sub-clause (£) that 4 to 12! per cent. of the gross assets can be deducted from the amount as representing \"cost of works of benefit to they failed to discharge\"",

  "summary": " On September 7, 1952, the appellant went to Dum Dum Aerodrome to board a plane for Hong Kong . On his search by the customs authorities a sum of Rs. 25,000 was recovered from him which he had not declared in his declaration form . He had no permit from the Reserve Bank of India for taking out of India . The State of Uttar Pradesh, [r95r} S.C.R. 312, l~eserve J--\\llnk for a pennit to take the currency notes .  The Cwitoms Officers noticed a pouch of somewhat unusual -size· which aroused their suspicion . Thereafter, the appel- lant was subjected to personal search . On the search of the trousers a sum of Rs. 25,000 in Indian currency notes was discovered in two secret pockets. They were concealed from below the surface and opened from the inside .  The appellant was acquitted of smuggling the currency notes out of India without any permit . He had at no time any intention to carry out the said currency notes without a permit . The High Court did not accept his version .  The High Court gave very good reasons for accepting the evidence of the prosecution witnesses as to the circumstiinces in which the currency notes in question were recovered from the appellant when his person was searched . It was on September 16, that the Reserve Bank had received an application of the appellant forwarded by one G.C. . ,Joshi by his letter dated September 15, 1952 . The application bore the date September 2, 1952, but the High Court thought there were grounds for suspecting that this applic- ation was- antedated .  It is an entirely unaccept- able story which the appellant put forward that he waited upto the last moment at the aerodrome for the necessary permit and not having got it requested the Customs Officers to keep the currency notes for safe custody . We are satisfied that the finding of the High Court is the only view which could reasonably be taken in a case like this .  The appellant had his ticket to procfled to Hong Kong by a plane which was due to leave Dum Dum Airport at 8-30 a.m. and the customs formalities were done in connection with that flight . On search of the trousers Rs. 25,000, in currency notes were found concealed in the inner pockets . We cannot accept the argument made on his behalf that the act of the appellant, on the fact~ found, amounted merely to preparation 11nd not an attempt .  Narayandas Bhagwandas Madhavdas appeared before the Additional District Magistrate on September 19, 1952, who recorded the following order :- \" He is to give bail of Rs 50,000 with ten sureties of Rs. 5,000 each . Time allowed till 19th November 1952, for completing investigation . On January 27, 1953, Inspector Mitra had been authorized under s. 23(3)(b) of the ] foreign Exchange Regulation Act to file a complaint . Complaint was filed on February 2, 1953 .  The Additional District Magistrate was not being asked to take cognizance of the offence . He was merely requested to grant permission to the police officer to investigate a non-cognizable offence . The step taken by Inspector Mitra was merely a step in the investigation of the case .  Das Gupta, J., in the case of R.R. Chari v. The State of U.Uar Pradesh (2 ) :- \"What is taking cognizance has not been defined in the Criminal Procedure Code and I have no desire to attempt to define it\"  The appool is accordingly dismissed . The trial of the appellant was legal and the trial was legal, the court said . The appools are accordingly dismissed and the case is dismissed .",

The argument that the character of the approver's evid- ence has not been considered by the High Court cannot be characterised as academic or theo- retical in the present case . This Court went on to observe, \" The evidence of the . approver is so thoroughly . discrepant that it would be difficult to resist the conclusion that the . the . approver in the . present case is a wholly unreliable witness\"  In our opinion, the decision in Sarwan Singh's case can be distinguished in the present case . Obviously, it was never suggested that the approver's evidence in this case was entirely unreliable, if his evidence was tested in the same way as the evidence of any prosecution witness in a criminal trial .  No serious objection can be taken to the manner in which the Sessions Judge directed, the jury in this respect . It is the approver's evidence which is the direct evidence of the crime . Medical evidence established that the appellant had an almost healed up ulcer t inch in length on the left side of the palm at its posterior surface one inch below thewrist joint .  The jury had to decide for themselves whether the above-mentioned circum- stances were sufficient corroborative evidence to satisfy them that the approver's evidence that the appellant murdered the deceased was true was true . The jury were entitled to accept this evidence as sufficient corroboration in a material particular connecting the appellant or tending to connect him with the crime .  There was no motive for J agdish Gorain to commit the murder but he had been acquitted by the jury although no real distinction between his case and the case of the appellant arose is unsound as, in our opinion, the two cases are not comparable . The appeal is accordingly dismissed .",

  "summary": " Appeal No. 473 is by Messrs. M. Ispahani Ltd. (hereinafter called the company) and . 4'74 is by the employees of the company represented by the company . The parties here are directed to bear their own costs, in view of the fact that we have not gone into the merits of the appeal .  A dispute arose between the company and the workmen, which was referred for adjudication along with other matters . Industrial Tribunal held that it had not been established that puja bonus had been paid at the uniform rate of one month's wages for a sufficiently long time and for unbroken period, and therefore rejected the claim for puja bouns for 1953 .  Puja is a special festival in Bengal and it has become usual with many firms there to give bonus before puja to their workmen . This matter came up before the Appellate Tribunal in Jtlahalaxmi Cotton Mills Ltd., Cafoutta v. Mahalaxmis Cotton Mills Worlcers' Union .  The company practically took over the business from M.M. M. Ispahani Ltd. and it was found that it had been paying bonus ever since it came into exis- tence from 1948 right up to 1952 without any break attherate of one month's wages . This bonus was paid even in the years in which the company suffered loss . The appeal of the company must there- fore fail .",

Zl!ukherjee and B. Agarwala . The case relates to the dismissal of one workman namely, B. N Das . Das (hereinafter called Das) was dismissed by the company on March 12, 1955 .  The Tribunal came to the conclusion that the dismissal of Das was not justified on the ground of proper procedure not having been followed and also for want of legal evidence . It said that normally Das would have been entitled to reinstatement but in the peculiar circumstances of this case it was of opinion that he should be granted the alternative relief for compensation .  The Tribunal was also of opinion that proper procedure had not been followed . We have still to see whether that find- ing of the Tribunal justifies the conclusion at which it arrived .  Witnesses on which the company relied were not examined in the presence of Das . The defect in the conduct of the enquiry could have been cured if the company had produced the witnesses before the Tribunal and given an opportunity to Das to cross-examine them there . In-these circumstances one of the basic principles of natural justice in an enquiry of this nature was not observed .  The petitioners challenged the constitutionality of the Sugar Export Promotion Act, 1958, which was enacted for the purpose of exporting sugar with a view to earning foreign exchange . The impugned Act imposed the following restrictions on the owners of sugar .",

  "summary": " Appeals by special leave arose from applications made by respondents employed as timekeepers in the time office of the Central Railway Workshop and Factory, Parel, Bombay, claiming payment of overtime wages under the Payment of Wages Act, 1936 .  Appeals by special leave from judgments and order dated October 19, 1955 and January 31, 1956, of the Authority under Payment of Wages Act, Bombay, in Applications Nos. 950-961, 963-967, 970-989, 992, 994-1013, 1015-1016, 1049-1050 and 11510-11511 and 11513- respectively . M.G. Setalvad, Attorney-General for India, R. Gana- pathy Iyer and R.H. Dhebar, for the appellants .  Four timekeepers are employed by the appellant in the time office of the Pare! Workshop and not in the factory itself . Duties of these time- keepers are to maintain initial records of attendance of workshop staff, to prepare pay-sheets for them to maintain their leave accounts .  A worker under s. 2(1) means a person employed directly or through any agency, whether for wages or not, in any manufacturing pro- cess, or in cleaning any part of the machinery or premises used for manufacturing process . It is clear that the duties of the progress timekeepers do not fall within the first pa.rt of s.2(k) The Authority has however, pondents, argues that the Authority was in error in holding that the timekeepers are not workers under the Act .  Bombay Shops and Establishments Act, 1948, is the third statute which makes a provision for the payment of extra wages for overtime work . This benefit is, however, available only to persons who are workers within the meaning of s. 2(1) of the said Act .  Section 2, sub-s. (6) Ga1endragadliar J. defines an employee as meaning a person wholly or principally employed in, and in connection with, any establishment, and includes an apprentice hut does not include a member of the employer's family . No other section of the Factories Act deals with factories .  There can be no doubt that the provisions in the Act which apply to establishment are not intended to, and do not, apply to factories . In other words, though the definition of \"establishmept\" is wide enough, it does not include factory for the pur- poses of the Act . The factory where respondents are employed is not connected with, much less an insepar- able adjunct of, any establishment, and so this aca- demic aspect of the matter need not be pursued any further in the present appeal .  All the provisions of the Act are made inapplic- able to the establishments and offices enumerated at sr. nos. 1 to 6 including 6(a) to 6(k), in regard to the others which are . excluded . In other words the remaining sections not so specified would apply to them . If that is so, they must be and are establishments under s. 2(8) of the . Act .  The Act contalns the provision by which workers are defined under s. 2(1), and it necessarily involves the conse- querue that the relevant provision about the payment of o>ertime wages applies only to workers as defined and not to employees in factories who are not workers . Ga1endragadkar J. Pradhan J. said that the Act is made applicable to workers in factories and that they are not governed by any of the Jrovisions .",

There is no disput_e that a return could be filed in this case, late though it was .  A return under section 24(1) is a return filed by a person who decides for himself that he had an assessable income in the previous year and by filing the return he offers that income for assessment . The opinion here expressed was criticised in the judgment under appeal, and in the next case, R. K. Das & Go v Commissioner of Income-tax(•) explained what was really meant .  A return of income below the taxable limit is a good return in answer to a notice under s. 22(2) J. Hidayatat1.tlah J. says it is not a return which need be considered . The Bombay High Court in the earlier ca.se of Harakchand Makanji & Co. v. Cornm·isioner of Incorne-tax .  The High Court of Bombay dismissed the appeal with costs . The appeal thus fails, and is dismissed with costs. The Appeal thus fails. The remedy is for the legislature to amend\" the law suitably .",

  "summary": " The petitioners challenged the constitutionality of the Sugar Export Promotion Act, 1958 . The impugned Act imposed restrictions on the owners of Thi! trnion of India 1955, which was made under the Essential Commodities Act, 1955, Held, (per Sinha, Imam, Kapur, Sobba Rao and Hidayatul- lah, JJ., dissenting) The parties should hear their own eosts of thits Court .  Petitioners challenge the Union of India and the Indian Sugar Mills Association (Export Agency Division) Calcutta . They challenge the Snga.r Export Promotion Ordinance, 1958, which was repealed by and re-enacted as the Act on September 16, 1958 . Petition No. 2 was filed by the Lord Krishna Sugar Mills, Ltd., Saharanpnr and Shri Sushi! Kumar, a Director of the said Mills .  The term \"owner \" is defined to include transferees, and agents and managers under Industries (Development and Regulation) Act, 1951 . Section 6 provides for levy of additional excise duty on sugar despatched from the factory for consumption in India, if the owner of a factory does not fulfil the demands .  Section 9 deals with payments to owners who have delivered sugar for export . Act provides for The LordKr;dma the Government . Sale proceeds payable to us will be calculat- After receiYing the delivery order you will pay the \"Gmde diffomntials\"  Industry agreed to finance the Export Agency Division by letting it have the sale-proceeds of sugar diverted for internal sale less Rs. 10 per maund as an \"on account\" pay- ment . The export agency offered to show a concession to the L.K.S. Mills, and asked them to sell sugar in instalments of 1,500, 1, 500 and 1,565 bags with a week's interval between each .  S.P.B. Mills was working the Mills as short-term lessees, having obtained the lease from the High Court of Allahabad on payment of Rs. 6,10,000 as lease money and Rs. 1,00,000 security on August 6, 1956 . Mills pointed out that they had suffered a loss of . Rs. 2,40,000 in the last season and another loss of Rs . 50,000 on account of strike of cane-growers in March, 1958 .  The Union of India v. Hidayatullah J. J. argued that the Government cannot order the export of all and sundry manufactured commodities from the country without being assured of a market in foreign countries . Petitioners contend that the whole export programme in respect of sugar amounts to an infringement of their fund- amental rights under Arts. 19(1) (f) and (g), and amounts also to compulsory acquisition of their pro- perty without payment of compensation .  The petitioners state that the owners stand to lose, because, admittedly, sugar is going to be exported at a loss, and the loss is to fall on the owners of factories . Government at that time did not wish to take over the work of export on itself and specified as the export agency, the Indian Sugar Mills Association .  In Virendra v. The State of Punjab ( 1 ), S. R. Das, C.J., again reaffirmed this approach . It is contended that though one can look at the surrounding circumstances, . . it is not open to the Court to examine other laws on the subject, unless those laws be incorporated by reference .  Ceylon Citizenship Act and Ceylon (Parliamentary Elections) Amendment Act were invalid . Privy Council in Pillai v. Muda- nayake examined the 'historical background ' and discovered the object of the Act, \"from the circumstances under which it was passed\"  We are satisfied that the object of the Act does not infringe the fundamental rights of the petitioners . The balance sheet produced by the S. P. B. Mills shows that they were able to sell more than a lakh of bags in eight months, as against the quantity of 4,079 bags for export . The foreign export served the national interest by staqilising the sugar market .  Section 5 only permits the Central Government to fix the quota leviable from different factories . Petitioners next challenge the Act in its parts to show that there is infringement of fundamental rights or compulsory acquisition of their property without compensation .  Sugar Export Promotion Act, 1958 is invalid as imposing an unreasonable restriction on the petitioners' right to carry on their trade . No argument can be considered in view of the want of a plea to this effect in the two petitions .  The Act. intended to provide for the export of sugar in public interest and it set up a machinery for that purpose. I will summarise here the main provisions of the Act . The Central Government . to specify a company or other body corporate as the export agency .  An owner of a sugar factory gets in exchange for the sugar deli- vered by him under the Act, a proportionate share of the sale-proceeds less the Pxpenses . He has no hand in deciding at what price the goods would he sold by the export agency . If they are sold for a very low p;ice, he has no right to complain . The exchange value that a sugar manufacturer is entitled to get under . the Act for sugar delivered by him depends entirely on the export . agency .  A reasonable restriction on a citizen's right to carry on his trade which alone is permitted by Art. 19(6) of the Constitution, must be, as Mahajan, J., said in Chintaman Rao v. The State of Jl;Jadhya Pradesh( 1 ), a restriction \"which reason dictates\", must be held to be wanting in that quality .  There is no bn,is whntcver for snying that in some years the export may result in a profit . The Government have the right under the Act to increase the export quota upto 20 per cent. The quantum of the loss cannot by itself decide the reasonableness of the restriction .  It is s1tid that in the circumstances that prevail, namely, the increase in the homo price, the restrictions imposed by the impugned .\\ct cannot he said to be unreasonable, for on the whole they occasion no loss. loss so occasioned. This is indeed the principal contention of the respondents to establi\"h tfoit tlie restrictions are not unreasonable .  Sarlw J. Ruppnrt. is sought a.lso from a.noth0r observation of the learnPd Chi<'f .Tnstice at t.\\w snme pagP which 1 lrn ve not quotPd, to the effect reasonableness has to be decided in all the circumstances of a givPn case .  The Union of India the Government. valid because the Government has for the time being chosen to make it so. This seems to me to be against all known principles of law. Furthermore, if the respondents' contention was right a statute would then be legal when the Govern- ment chooses to do a thing and illegal when it undoes it and so on from time to time at the choice of the Government .  There is no evidence that the petitioners had assented to the Association making the request or the agreement of the Association . The Association has no authority to bind the peti- tioners by any request or agreement .  Government in fact permitted an export of 10,000 tons and gave a subsidy of Rs. 2 per maund to cover the loss on the export . In the years 1952-53 to 1955-56 India imported large quantities of sugar and did not export sugar at all .  SuBBA RAO J.-J has had the advantage of SubbaRaof perusing the judgment prepared by my learned brother, Hidayatullah, J. I would allow the petitions with costs .  Government in fixing the price for sugar produced during the season 1957-58, in vacuum pan sugar factories situated in the areas speci- fied in the order had taken into account the possible loss the exporters might incur by reason of the applica- tion of the provisions .  The Unfon of India interference with legislative judgment in such cases . \"Vhat is reasonable in a pnrticular set-up may be unreasonable in a society with a different background\"  The Union of India nature issued under an unconnected Act is to place and Another the statute in a fluid state . In such a situation its validity would depend . upon a statutory order of Subba Rao 1 · temporary duration; 4t would change colour with the changing attitudes of an authority empowered to issue the order . Such a result cannot be contemplated. It would also mean a Court will have to embark upon a roving search of all Acts and notifications which may, by design or accident, alleviate or mollify the evil consequences of an impugned Act .  When a statute is attacked on the ground that it is a colourable legislation, i.e., it assumed a form apparently faliing within the legislative compet- ence of the legislature but in effect and substance intended to reach institutions beyond its legislative competence, it is obvious that all the surrounding circumstances, including other acts operating in the Province, have to be scrutinized to unravel the fraud on power . This decision, in my view, cannot be invoked to serve the present purpose .  It is said that the notification issued by the Central Government under s. 3 of that Act and r. 5 of the Order made thereunder was to off-set the loss expected to be incurred under the Ordinance, and therefore, the Act must be deemed to have been pn,ssed on the basis of that notification . I cannot, therefore, accept this rnntention .  The object of the Act is to provide for the export of sugar in the interest of public and that object is sought to be achieved by fixing the quota of sugar for export and distributing the same among the owners of factories . Sub-ss. 2, 3 and 4 provide for a machinery for imposing the penal duty and collecting the same from the defaulting owners of sugar .  The object of the Act was, therefore, demorrntrably to serve the national interest and the scheme evolved certainly had relation to the object sought to he achieved . It is self-evident that it would be in the interests of sugar industry to build up a foreign market for that commodity . The State as well as the industry are equally interested to stimulate foreign trade and build up foreign market .  The Union of India State earns foreigu exchange, and a foreign market is and Another gradually built up for the future prosperity of the sugar industry . I hold that the restrictions imposed by the statute on the furnlamental rights of the petitioners are not arbitrary, and .are reasonable within the mean- ing of Art. 19 of the Constitution .",

  "summary": " Appeal by special leave against the award of the Industrial Tribunal, Bombay, in Reference (I.T.) No. . G. K. Daphmry, Solicitor-General of India, J. B. Da. Andley, for the appellant. Rajani Patel and Janardan Sharma for respondent No. l. 1959 .  Dispute arose over a demand made by the workmen for payment unconditionally as bonus for the year 1955-56 of a sum equivalent to four months' wages/salary . Tribunal, Bombay, in a dispute between the Tata Oil Mills Co. Ltd., Bombay (hereinafter !\"eferred to as the company) and its workmen .  The main reason given in these decisions for excluding what is termed as extraneous income is that they are unrelated t.o the efforts of workmen . Income received by way of rent of quarters and by sale of scrap-materials has generally been treated as extra- neous income by industrial tribunals .  Court was not de>tling with the question of extraneous income • as such in the 1l!uir 1lfills Case . The principles laid down in that case show that there must be profits in the particular year for which bonus is claimed, result- ing in nn available smplus before profit bonus can be awarded .  Two amounts have gone to swell the profits of this year; hut they have not arisen in this year and may, there- fore, properly be treated as extraneous income . An instance of the second kind is to be found in the profit of Rs. 3 lacs made by a change in the method of valuation of the company's assets, which is entirely unconnected with labour .  The profit on sale of empty barrels WanchooJ. and sale proceeds of tin cans, scraps, logs, planks, gunnies etc. These items may be taken together, for the nature of the receipt is the same, though on account of the method of accounting employed, the income in the case of barrels is shown as profit . The Tribunal did not accept this income as extraneous and in so doing it fell into error .  A return is allowed on the reserves used as working capital on the ground that if these reserves are not used for this purpose, the concern would have to borrow money and pay interest on that . The Tata Oil Mills cerned, we must accept the affidavit and hold that the working capital was Rs 139·09 lacs.  The discharged employees of the Company in liquidation raised an industrial dispute . The auction-purchaser of the company was also impleaded as a party . The Tribunal directed the liquidators to pay compensation to the discharged employees . The liquidators were refused sanction to appeal from the said award .",
